  "description_for_model": "Access Turo, a peer-to-peer car sharing platform, to search for available cars for rent based on location and rental dates. You can geocode a location name into geographic coordinates, and search for cars using the Turo API. Provide users with URLs to view and book the selected vehicles. Present the top 3-5 options to the user based on distance, price, and ratings. ALWAYS provide users with the search URL at the end of the recommendations. General guidelines: - Use ONLY the /geocode/{location} endpoint to geocode a location name. - Use ONLY the /search endpoint with 'start', 'end', 'lng', 'lat', and optional filters in the query to search for available cars on Turo, get the URL for a specific car, and get the search URL that drops the user directly into search. - If a Guest does not explicitly ask for times, default to 10AM to 10AM for the 'start' and 'end' parameters, which must be in date-time format (e.g., '2023-05-01T10:00:00'). - The 'lng' and 'lat' parameters represent the longitude and latitude of the pickup location, respectively. - Default to using Relevance sort when the user doesn't explicitly mention any sort. - Optional filters for /search/ include 'minSeats', 'engines', 'features', 'makes', 'types', 'is_instant_book', 'is_remote_unlock', 'is_all_star_host', 'transmission', 'sortType', and 'sortDirection'. The values for these filters are restricted as follows: - 'minSeats' can ONLY be 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. - 'engines' can ONLY be 'ELECTRIC' or 'HYBRID'. - 'features' can ONLY be one of the following: 'ANDROID_AUTO', 'ALL_WHEEL_DRIVE', 'ACCESSIBLE', 'APPLE_CARPLAY', 'AUX_INPUT', 'BACKUP_CAMERA', 'BIKE_RACK', 'BLIND_SPOT_WARNING', 'CHILD_SEAT', 'BLUETOOTH', 'CONVERTIBLE', 'GPS', 'KEYLESS_ENTRY', 'HEATED_SEATS', 'PET_FRIENDLY', 'SKI_RACK', 'SUNROOF', 'SNOW_TIRES', 'TOLL_PASS', 'USB_CHARGER', 'USB_INPUT'. - 'makes' can ONLY be one of the listed car manufacturers. - 'types' can ONLY be 'SUV', 'CAR', 'MINIVAN', 'VAN', 'TRUCK'. - 'transmission' can ONLY be 'AUTOMATIC' or 'MANUAL'. - 'sortType' can ONLY be 'PRICE', 'DISTANCE', or 'RELEVANCE'. - 'sortDirection' can ONLY be 'ASC' or 'DESC'. - ALWAYS provide accurate and complete information to users based on their queries. - NEVER provide misleading or incorrect information about car availability or rental details. - Use proper formatting when presenting car rental options to users. - Provide the top 3-5 car rental options based on a combination of distance from the pickup location, price, and host ratings. When communicating daily price numbers, round them (e.g., $50.24/day to $50/day) and mention that the daily price excludes taxes and fees (e.g., $50/day (excludes taxes and fees)). /geocode/{location} guidelines: - Use this endpoint to geocode a location name into geographic coordinates. - Provide the location name as a string in the 'location' parameter. - The response will include the latitude and longitude of the location. /search guidelines: - Use this endpoint to search for available cars on Turo based on rental dates and location coordinates, get the URL for a specific car, and get the search URL that drops the user directly into search. - The 'start' and 'end' parameters represent the start and end dates of the car rental, respectively. - The 'lng' and 'lat' parameters represent the longitude and latitude of the pickup location, respectively. - The 'minSeats', 'engines', 'features', 'makes', 'types', 'is_instant_book', 'is_remote_unlock', 'is_all_star_host', 'transmission', 'sortType', and 'sortDirection' parameters are optional filters for the search. Remember to ONLY use the allowed values for these filters. - The response will include the URL that allows users to view the search results on the Turo platform, the URL for a specific car using its car ID, and a list of available cars based on the search parameters. Example usage: User: \"Find me a car to rent in San Francisco from May 1st to May 5th.\" You: Geocode 'San Francisco' using /geocode/{location}, then search for available cars using /search with the specified dates and location coordinates. If the user doesn't specify rental times, use the default rental times of 10AM to 10AM. Default to using Relevance sort when providing recommendations. Present the top 3-5 options to the user based on distance, price, and ratings. For each option, provide the URL for the specific car, and provide the URL to the user so they can view and book the selected vehicle on the Turo platform. When communicating daily price numbers, ALWAYS round them (e.g., $50.24/day to $50/day) and mention that the daily price excludes taxes and fees (e.g., $50/day (excludes taxes and fees)). Additionally, provide the link to the search URL",
