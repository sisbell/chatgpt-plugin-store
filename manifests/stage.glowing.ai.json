  "description_for_model": "The Glowing plugin enables ChatGPT users to schedule and send daily SMS messages globally to any valid mobile number, which must include the country code. The content of the messages will be generated by ChatGPT based on the theme provided by the user. Some examples of themes or types of messages that users can schedule include, but are not limited to: a different 6 a.m. daily workout, afternoon vegan recipes, reminders to meditate, and daily motivational quotes. Users would need to provide the following information: 1. Name 2. Valid mobile number. User needs to provide a valid mobile number, including the country code 3. Local time zone. User can provide either the city name or the UTC time zone  4. Start date. Date must be no later than 7 days from the present day 5. End date. Date must be no more than 21 days from the start date 6. Theme Theme examples could include, but are not limited to: 'Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation. Morning weight-training motivational quote. 10-minute HIIT workout. Late afternoon dinner recipe idea. Witty joke for my engineer friends.' More specific and descriptive themes lead to more relevant and engaging messages. Instead of 'morning workout quote,' consider 'morning strength-training quote as I train for my triathlon.â When the user provides the theme, ChatGPT will generate a set of unique messages based on that theme. ChatGPT will generate one unique message for every scheduled day. These messages will be stored by Glowing and sent to the user according to the user's schedule. The content of each message will be different and needs to be 155 characters or less.  Ask the user for permission before revealing the content of any generated messages to the user, including sample messages, shortened messages, scheduled messages or any type of messages. If the user has confirmed they do not want to see the content of generated messages, generate the messages without revealing any message content, as well as create the schedule without showing the user any of the messages. Examples of themes with a sample associated message: Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation: 'Inhale: I am calm. Exhale: I release stress. Inhale: I am present. Exhale: I let go. Repeat for 1 min. You're doing greatâbreathe and be at peace.' Morning weight-training motivational quote: 'Morning grind! Embrace the iron, push your limits, and sculpt greatness. Each rep brings you closer to your goals. Let's lift and conquer the day!' 10-minute HIIT workout: '10-min HIIT: 30s Jumping Jacks, 30s Squats, 30s Push-ups, 30s Plank, 30s Burpees. Repeat 2x. Rest 30s between exercises. Cool down/stretch.' Late afternoon dinner recipe idea: Garlic Shrimp Pasta: Cook pasta. SautÃ© garlic, shrimp, chili flakes in oil. Add lemon juice, zest, salt. Toss with pasta. Top with parsley, Parmesan. Witty joke for my engineer friends: 'Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!' Once a user creates or modifies a schedule, the user should receive a confirmation that includes the start date, time, end date, theme, and information that the user can return to modify or cancel anytime.  Ask the user for permission before revealing the content of any generated messages to the user, including sample messages, shortened messages, scheduled messages or any type of messages. If the user has confirmed they do not want to see the content of generated messages, generate the messages without revealing any message content, as well as create the schedule without showing the user any of the messages. Users can request to view, modify or cancel existing daily SMS schedules.  When the user requests to view, modify or cancel a daily SMS schedule, ChatGPT will first prompt the user to provide their registered mobile phone number, including the country code.  ChatGPT will not assume what the userâs mobile phone number is. This information is required for the Glowing plugin to locate the user's existing schedule. Users cannot send ad hoc individual SMS messages.  SMS messages must be scheduled.Users cannot send messages to anyone except themselves.  If there is any doubt as to whose mobile number was provided by the user, then ask. Do not assume.",
